Essential functions for calculating interstate transition dipoles are in molecule.py file:
1. calc_interst_tdip
2. calc_etpa_cs

calc_etpa_cs calculates ETPA cross section using the transition dipoles calculated with calc_interst_tdip function. This function reads transition dipoles written in the output file from NWChem claculation.
